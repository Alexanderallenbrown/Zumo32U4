\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Play beeps and music with the buzzer. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer}{Pololu\+Buzzer}} library allows various sounds to be played through a buzzer, from simple beeps to complex tunes.

On the ATmega328\+P/168 boards, this library uses Timer 2 and pin 3 (PD3/\+OC2B). On ATmega32\+U4 boards, this library uses Timer 4 and pin 6 (PD7/\+OC4D). This library will conflict will other libraries that use the same timer or pin.

Note durations are timed using a timer overflow interrupt ({\ttfamily TIMER2\+\_\+\+OVF}/{\ttfamily TIMER4\+\_\+\+OVF}), which will briefly interrupt execution of your main program at the frequency of the sound being played. In most cases, the interrupt-\/handling routine is very short (several microseconds). However, when playing a sequence of notes in {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+AUTOMATIC} mode (the default mode) with the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}} command, this interrupt takes much longer than normal (perhaps several hundred microseconds) every time it starts a new note. It is important to take this into account when writing timing-\/critical code.

This library is fully compatible with the Orangutan\+Buzzer functions in the \href{http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J18}{\texttt{ Pololu AVR C/\+C++ Library}} and the \href{https://github.com/pololu/zumo-shield}{\texttt{ Zumo\+Buzzer library}}, so any sequences and melodies written for those libraries will also work with the equivalent \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer}{Pololu\+Buzzer}} functions.

Checks whether a note, frequency, or sequence is being played. 

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
1 if the buzzer is current playing a note, frequency, or sequence; 0 otherwise.
\end{DoxyReturn}
This method returns 1 (true) if the buzzer is currently playing a note/frequency or if it is still playing a sequence started by {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}}. Otherwise, it returns 0 (false). You can poll this method to determine when it\textquotesingle{}s time to play the next note in a sequence, or you can use it as the argument to a delay loop to wait while the buzzer is busy.

{\footnotesize\ttfamily void Pololu\+Buzzer\+::play (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{const char $\ast$}]{sequence }\end{DoxyParamCaption})\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [static]}}



Plays the specified sequence of notes. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em sequence} & Char array containing a sequence of notes to play.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
If the play mode is {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+AUTOMATIC} (default), the sequence of notes will play with no further action required by the user. If the play mode is {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+CHECK}, the user will need to call {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a427225dcc85c1e65078e4397b9890929}{play\+Check()}}} in the main loop to initiate the playing of each new note in the sequence. The play mode can be changed while the sequence is playing. The sequence syntax is modeled after the PLAY commands in GW-\/\+BASIC, with just a few differences.

The notes are specified by the characters {\bfseries{C}}, {\bfseries{D}}, {\bfseries{E}}, {\bfseries{F}}, {\bfseries{G}}, {\bfseries{A}}, and {\bfseries{B}}, and they are played by default as \char`\"{}quarter notes\char`\"{} with a length of 500 ms. This corresponds to a tempo of 120 beats/min. Other durations can be specified by putting a number immediately after the note. For example, C8 specifies C played as an eighth note, with half the duration of a quarter note. The special note {\bfseries{R}} plays a rest (no sound). The sequence parser is case-\/insensitive and ignores spaces, which may be used to format your music nicely.

This function plays the string of notes in the background while your program continues to execute. If you call another buzzer function while the melody is playing, the new function call will overwrite the previous and take control of the buzzer. If you want to string melodies together, you should put an appropriate delay after you start a melody playing. You can use the {\ttfamily is\+\_\+playing()} function to figure out when the buzzer is through playing the melody.\hypertarget{class_pololu_buzzer_autotoc_md1}{}\doxyparagraph{Example}\label{class_pololu_buzzer_autotoc_md1}

Starts the next note in a sequence, if necessary, in {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+CHECK} mode. 

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
0 if sequence is complete, 1 otherwise.
\end{DoxyReturn}
This method only needs to be called if you are in {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+CHECK} mode. It checks to see whether it is time to start another note in the sequence initiated by {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}}, and starts it if so. If it is not yet time to start the next note, this method returns without doing anything. Call this as often as possible in your main loop to avoid delays between notes in the sequence. This method returns 0 (false) if the melody to be played is complete, otherwise it returns 1 (true).

Plays the specified frequency for the specified duration. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em freq} & Frequency to play in Hz (or 0.\+1 Hz if the {\ttfamily DIV\+\_\+\+BY\+\_\+10} bit is set). \\
\hline
{\em duration} & Duration of the note in milliseconds. \\
\hline
{\em volume} & Volume of the note (0--15).\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
The {\itshape frequency} argument must be between 40 Hz and 10 k\+Hz. If the most significant bit of {\itshape frequency} is set, the frequency played is the value of the lower 15 bits of {\itshape frequency} in units of 0.\+1 Hz. Therefore, you can play a frequency of 44.\+5 Hz by using a {\itshape frequency} of {\ttfamily (DIV\+\_\+\+BY\+\_\+10 $\vert$ 445)}. If the most significant bit of {\itshape frequency} is not set, the units for frequency are Hz. The {\itshape volume} argument controls the buzzer volume, with 15 being the loudest and 0 being the quietest. A {\itshape volume} of 15 supplies the buzzer with a 50\% duty cycle PWM at the specified {\itshape frequency}. Lowering {\itshape volume} by one halves the duty cycle (so 14 gives a 25\% duty cycle, 13 gives a 12.\+5\% duty cycle, etc). The volume control is somewhat crude (especially on the ATmega328/168) and should be thought of as a bonus feature.

This function plays the note in the background while your program continues to execute. If you call another buzzer function while the note is playing, the new function call will overwrite the previous and take control of the buzzer. If you want to string notes together, you should either use the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}} function or put an appropriate delay after you start a note playing.

{\em mode} & Play mode (either {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+AUTOMATIC} or {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+CHECK}).\\

\end{DoxyParams}
This method lets you determine whether the notes of the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}} sequence are played automatically in the background or are driven by the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a427225dcc85c1e65078e4397b9890929}{play\+Check()}}} method. If {\itshape mode} is {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+AUTOMATIC}, the sequence will play automatically in the background, driven by the timer overflow interrupt. The interrupt will take a considerable amount of time to execute when it starts the next note in the sequence playing, so it is recommended that you do not use automatic-\/play if you cannot tolerate being interrupted for more than a few microseconds. If {\itshape mode} is {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+CHECK}, you can control when the next note in the sequence is played by calling the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a427225dcc85c1e65078e4397b9890929}{play\+Check()}}} method at acceptable points in your main loop. If your main loop has substantial delays, it is recommended that you use automatic-\/play mode rather than play-\/check mode. Note that the play mode can be changed while the sequence is being played. The mode is set to {\ttfamily PLAY\+\_\+\+AUTOMATIC} by default.

This function plays the note in the background while your program continues to execute. If you call another buzzer function while the note is playing, the new function call will overwrite the previous and take control of the buzzer. If you want to string notes together, you should either use the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pololu_buzzer_a22f45ef7cdf9dc8fc54e617244368277}{play()}}} function or put an appropriate delay after you start a note playing. You can use the {\ttfamily is\+\_\+playing()} function to figure out when the buzzer is through playing its note or melody.
