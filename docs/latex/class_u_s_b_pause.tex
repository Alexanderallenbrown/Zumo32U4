\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class disables U\+SB interrupts in its constructor when it is created and restores them to their previous state in its destructor when it is destroyed. This class is tailored to the behavior of the Arduino core U\+SB code, so it might have to change if that code changes.

This class assumes that the only U\+SB interrupts enabled are general device interrupts and endpoint 0 interrupts.

It also assumes that the endpoint 0 interrupts will not enable or disable any of the general device interrupts.
